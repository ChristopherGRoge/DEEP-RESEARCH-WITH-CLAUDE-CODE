However, it is not recommended for a production instance, and has limitations depending on the OS you are deploying to, as well as the associated resources. See the troubleshooting section for additional information.\n\nCode Insights is not supported in Single Container deployments. To try Code Insights you must deploy using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Tracing is disabled by default, and if you intend to enable it, you will have to deploy and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector. The Single Container deployment does not ship with this service included. It is strongly recommended to use one of the aforementioned deployment methods if tracing support is a requirement.\n\nInstallation\n\nIt takes less than a minute to run and install Sourcegraph using Docker:\n\nSHELL\ndocker run\n--publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm\n--volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph\n--volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph\nsourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\n\nOnce the server is ready (logo is displayed in the terminal), navigate to the hostname or IP address on port 7080. Create the admin account, then you'll be guided through setting up Sourcegraph for code searching and navigation.\n\nFor next steps and further configuration options, review the high-level configuration items below, or visit the detailed configuration documentation.\n\nWARNING: We do not recommend using this method for a production instance. If deploying a production instance, see our recommendations for how to choose a deployment type that suits your needs. We recommend Docker Compose for most initial production deployments.\n\nConfiguration\nConfigure exposed Sourcegraph port\n\nChange the docker --publish argument to make it listen on the specific interface and port on your host machine. For example, docker run ... --publish 0.0.0.0:80:7080 ... would make it accessible on port 80 of your machine. For more information, see \"Publish or expose port\" in the Docker documentation.\n\nThe other option is to deploy and run Sourcegraph on a cloud provider. For an example, see the cloud installation section.\n\nGit configuration and authentication\n\nFor single-container environments, upon the Sourcegraph Docker image container start, it copies all files from /etc/sourcegraph/{ssh,gitconfig,netrc} into its own $HOME directory, via the --volume /mnt/sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph in the docker run command.\n\nFor example, to mount a .gitconfig, create a file /mnt/sourcegraph/config/gitconfig on your host containing your configuration:\n\nSHELL\n# example .gitconfig\n\n[url \"example.url.com:\"]\n  insteadOf = \"ssh://example.url.com\"\n\nAlternatively you can create a new Docker image which inherits from Sourcegraph and then mutates the environment:\n\nDOCKERFILE\nFROM sourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\nCOPY gitconfig /etc/gitconfig\nCOPY ssh /root/.ssh\nRUN\tfind /root/.ssh -type f -exec chmod 600 '{}' ';'\nRUN\tfind /root/.ssh -type d -exec chmod 700 '{}' ';'\n\n\nThis approach can also be used for sourcegraph/gitserver images in cluster environments.\n\nLearn more about Git configuration and authentication.\n\nSSH authentication (config, keys, known_hosts)\n\nThe container consults its own file system (in the standard locations) for SSH configuration, private keys, and known_hosts. Upon container start, it copies all files from /etc/sourcegraph/ssh into its own $HOME/.ssh directory.\n\nTo provide SSH authentication configuration to the container, assuming you're using the default --volume $HOME/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph, follow these steps:\n\nCreate files at $HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh/config, $HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh/known_hosts, etc., on the host machine as desired to configure SSH.\nStart (or restart) the container.\n\nTo configure the container to use the same SSH as your user account on the host machine, you can also run cp -R $HOME/.ssh $HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh.\n\nHTTP(S) authentication via netrc\n\nThe easiest way to specify HTTP(S) authentication for repositories is to include the username and password in the clone URL itself, such as https://user:password@example.com/my/repo. These credentials won't be displayed to non-admin users.\n\nOtherwise, the container consults the $HOME/.netrc files on its own file system for HTTP(S) authentication. The .netrc file is a standard way to specify authentication used to connect to external hosts.\n\nTo provide HTTP(S) authentication, assuming you're using the default --volume $HOME/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a file at $HOME/.sourcegraph/config/netrc on the host machine that contains lines of the form machine example.com login alice password mypassword (replacing example.com, alice, and mypassword with the actual values).\nStart (or restart) the container.\nExpose debug port\n\nThis is required to collect debug data.\n\nThe docker run command for single-container Sourcegraph needs an additional publish flag to expose the debug port:\n\nSH\n$ docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --publish 127.0.0.1:6060:6060 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\n\nIf Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool such as sshuttle is required to establish a secure connection. To access the remote server using sshuttle from your local machine:\n\nSH\n$ sshuttle -r user@host 0/0\nEnvironment variables\n\nAdd the following to your docker run command:\n\nSH\n$ docker run [...]\n-e (YOUR CODE)\nsourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\nOperation\nAccess the database\n\nNOTE: To execute an SQL query against the database without first creating an interactive session (as below), append --command \"SELECT * FROM users;\" to the docker container exec command.\n\nGet the Docker container ID for Sourcegraph:\n\nSH\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE\nd039ec989761        sourcegraph/server:VERSION\n\nOpen a PostgreSQL interactive terminal:\n\nSH\n$ docker container exec -it d039ec989761 psql -U postgres sourcegraph\n\nRun your SQL query:\n\nSQL\nSELECT * FROM users;\nUpgrade\nPostgresql 16\n\nWarning: The 5.11 release updates the database container images from Postgres 12 to Postgres 16. Customers are advised to have a database backup before upgrading! See our postgres 12 end of life notice!\n\nFrom sourcegraph version 5.11 onwards, the Sourcegraph single container Docker image uses Postgresql 16. Upgrading from Postgresql 12 to Postgresql 16 is a manual process, that is similar to the one outlined below for multi-version upgrades, but migrator has been merged into the container, allowing for a simpler upgrade.\n\nNOTE: It is highly recommended to take an up-to-date snapshot of your databases prior to starting a multi-version upgrade. The upgrade process aggressively mutates the shape and contents of your database, and undiscovered errors in the migration process or unexpected environmental differences may cause an unusable instance or data loss.\n\nWe recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\n\nIf you do not feel confident running this process solo, contact customer support team to help guide you thorough the process.\n\nBefore performing a multi-version upgrade:\n\nRead our update policy to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\nFind the entries that apply to the version range you're passing through in the update notes for Sourcegraph with Docker Single Container.\nYou must first shutdown the container instance via docker stop [CONTAINER].\nStart a temporary Postgres container on top of the Postgres data directory used by the old sourcegraph/server image. You must use the new postgresql-16-codeinsights image, which is based on the new Postgresql 16 image, and provides an automatic upgrade script to move from Postgresql 12 to Postgresql 16.\n\ndocker run --rm -it -v ~/.sourcegraph/data/postgresql:/data/pgdata-12 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -p 5432:5432 sourcegraph/postgresql-16-codeinsights:6.11.2752\n\nOnce that temporary container marks that Postgresql has started, the migration is complete and you can stop the temporary container.\nStart the new sourcegraph/server container.\n\ndocker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\nYou now have a single server Sourcegraph container image running on Postgresql 16.\n\nStandard upgrades\n\nA standard upgrade occurs between two minor versions of Sourcegraph. If you are looking to jump forward several versions, you must perform a multi-version upgrade instead.\n\nBefore upgrading:\n\nRead our update policy to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\nFind the relevant entry for your update in the update notes for single-container Sourcegraph with Docker.\n\nTo update, just use the newer sourcegraph/server:N.N.N Docker image (where N.N.N is a patch or single minor release away your current version) in place of the older one, using the same Docker volumes. Your server's data will be migrated automatically if needed. You can always find the version number details of the latest release via the technical changelog.\n\nMulti-version upgrades\n\nNOTE: It is no longer necessary to run Migrator outside of the single instance container. Migrator is now built into the container, and will be run via the sourcegraph/server image.\n\nWe still recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\n\nThe below docs are kept for posterity for users on older versions of Sourcegraph that are looking to upgrade or run the migrator tool.\n\nTo update, just use the newer sourcegraph/server:N.N.N Docker image in place of the older one, using the same Docker volumes. Your server's data will be migrated automatically if needed. You can always find the version number details of the latest release via the technical changelog.\n\n(Legacy) Multi-version upgrades\n\nA multi-version upgrade is a downtime-incurring upgrade from version 3.20 or later to any future version. Multi-version upgrades will run both schema and data migrations to ensure the data available from the instance remains available post-upgrade.\n\nNOTE: It is highly recommended to take an up-to-date snapshot of your databases prior to starting a multi-version upgrade. The upgrade process aggressively mutates the shape and contents of your database, and undiscovered errors in the migration process or unexpected environmental differences may cause an unusable instance or data loss.\n\nWe recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\n\nIf you do not feel confident running this process solo, contact customer support team to help guide you thorough the process.\n\nBefore performing a multi-version upgrade:\n\nRead our update policy to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\nFind the entries that apply to the version range you're passing through in the update notes for Sourcegraph with Docker Single Container.\n\nTo perform a multi-version upgrade on a Sourcegraph instance running on Docker Single Container:\n\nStop the running Sourcegraph container via docker stop [CONTAINER].\nStart a temporary Postgres container on top of the Postgres data directory used by the old sourcegraph/server image. This Postgres instance will be used by the following upgrade migration. If using an external database, the database is already accessible from the migrator so no action is needed. Otherwise, start the new Postgres container by following the steps described below.\nFollow the instructions on how to run the migrator job in Docker to perform the upgrade migratiohn. For specific documentation on the upgrade command, see the command documentation. The following specific steps are an easy way to run the upgrade command:\n\nSH\n$ docker run \\\n  --rm \\\n  --name migrator_${SG_VERSION} \\\n  -e PGHOST='pgsql' \\\n  -e PGPORT='5432' \\\n  -e PGUSER='sg' \\\n  -e PGPASSWORD='sg' \\\n  -e PGDATABASE='sourcegraph' \\\n  -e PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGHOST='pgsql' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGPORT='5432' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGUSER='sg' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGPASSWORD='sg' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGDATABASE='sourcegraph-codeintel' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGHOST='pgsql' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGPORT='5432' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGUSER='postgres' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGPASSWORD='password' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGDATABASE='postgres' \\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PG_ALLOW_SINGLE_DB=true \\\n  sourcegraph/migrator:v${SG_VERSION} \\\n  upgrade --from=${CURRENT_SG_VERSION} --to=${SG_VERSION}\n\nIt is recommended to also add the --dry-run flag on a trial invocation to detect if there are any issues with database connection, schema drift, or mismatched versions that need to be addressed.\n\nAfter this container exits successfully, the remaining infrastructure can now be updated. All temporary containers can be stopped, and the Docker invocation for your sourcegraph/server container can be updated to use the new target version.\n\nRunning temporary Postgres containers\n\nMounting a Postgres container on top of the data directory used by sourcegraph/server will allow us to access and migrate the data in-place without having running services interfere.\n\nLet ${PATH} be the directory mounted into /var/opt/sourcegraph of your instance. This mount contains the Postgres data directory inside of the container.\n\nFor example, ${PATH} is ~/.sourcegraph/data in -v ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph.\n\nSH\n$ docker run --rm -it \\\n  -v ${PATH}/postgresql:/data/pgdata-12 \\\n  -u 70 \\\n  -p 5432:5432 \\\n  --entrypoint bash \\\n  sourcegraph/${PG_VERSION_TAG}:${SG_VERSION} \\\n  -c 'echo \"host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust\" >> /data/pgdata-12/pg_hba.conf && postgres -c l listen_addresses=\"*\" -D /data/pgdata-12'\n\nThe version of this Postgres container is dependent on the version of the instance prior to upgrade.\n\n${SG_VERSION}\t${PG_VERSION_TAG}\n3.20.X - 3.29.X\tpostgres-12.6\n3.30.X - 3.37.X\tpostgres-12.6-alpine\n3.38.X - 5.9.X\tpostgres-12-alpine\n5.10.X -\tpostgresql-16\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you get stuck or need help, please reach out to Sourcegraph support.\n\nMac Computers with Apple silicon\n\nOn Mac computers with Apple silicon, you’ll need to add an extra --platform linux/amd64 argument to your Docker command for correctly running and installing Sourcegraph.\n\nFile system performance on Docker for Mac\n\nThere is a known issue in Docker for Mac that causes slower than expected file system performance on volume mounts, which impacts the performance of search and cloning.\n\nTo achieve better performance, you can do any of the following:\n\nFor better clone performance, clone the repository on your host machine and then add it to Sourcegraph Server.\nTry adding the :delegated suffix the data volume mount. Learn more.\nSH\n--volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph:delegated\nTesting Sourcegraph on Windows\n\nSourcegraph can be tested on Windows 10 using roughly the same steps provided above, but data will not be retained after server restarts (this is due to a limitation of Docker on Windows).\n\nInstall Docker for Windows\nUsing a command prompt, follow the same installation steps provided above but remove the --volume arguments. For example by pasting this:\n\ndocker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish\n127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm \nsourcegraph/server:6.11.2752\n\nLow resource environments\n\nTo test Sourcegraph in a low resource environment you may want to disable some of the observability tools (Prometheus and Grafana).\n\nAdd -e DISABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true to your docker run command.\n\nStarting in Postgres restore mode\n\nIn order to restore a Postgres backup, you need to start on an empty database and prevent all other Sourcegraph services from starting. You can do this by adding -e PGRESTORE=true to your docker run command. This will start only the Postgres system and allow you to perform a restore. Once it is done, remove that parameter from your docker command.\n\nThe database is only accessible from within the container. To perform a restore you will need to copy the required files to the container and then execute the restore commands from within the container using docker exec.\n\nYou can find examples of this procedure for docker-compose in our docker-compose migration docs.\n\nSpecial instructions for RHEL, Fedora, CentOS and others\n\nIf you run Docker on an OS such as RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS with SELinux enabled, sVirt doesn't allow the Docker process to access ~/.sourcegraph/config and ~/.sourcegraph/data. In that case, you will see the following message:\n\nFailed to setup nginx:failed to generate nginx configuration to /etc/sourcegraph: open /etc/sourcegraph/nginx.conf: permission denied.\n\nTo fix this, run:\n\nmkdir -p ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data && chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data\n\nReference\nCloud installation guides\n\nCloud specific Sourcegraph installation guides for AWS, Google Cloud and Digital Ocean.\n\nInstall Sourcegraph with Docker on AWS\nInstall Sourcegraph with Docker on Google Cloud\nInstall Sourcegraph with Docker on DigitalOcean\nInsiders build\n\nTo test new development builds of Sourcegraph (triggered by commits to main), change the tag to insiders in the docker run command.\n\nWARNING: insiders builds may be unstable, so back up Sourcegraph's data and config (usually ~/.sourcegraph) beforehand.\n\nSH\n$ docker run --publish 7080:7080 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:insiders\n\nTo keep this up to date, run docker pull sourcegraph/server:insiders to pull in the latest image, and restart the container to access new changes.\n\nOn this page\nDocker Single Container Deployment\nInstallation\nConfiguration\nOperation\nUpgrade\nTroubleshooting\nReference\nEdit this page on GitHub\nCopy page as Markdown\nView as Markdown",

Deployment</h1>\n<p>The Docker Single Container deployment type is a way to very quickly get an instance of Sourcegraph set up locally to experiment with many of its features. However, it is <strong>not recommended</strong> for a production instance, and <strong>has limitations</strong> depending on the OS you are deploying to, as well as the associated resources. See the <a href=\"#troubleshooting\" class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\">troubleshooting section</a> for additional information.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\" href=\"/docs/code-insights\">Code Insights</a> is not supported in Single Container deployments. To try Code Insights you must deploy using <a class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\" href=\"/docs/self-hosted/deploy/docker-compose\">Docker Compose</a> or <a class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\" href=\"/docs/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a>. <a class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\" href=\"/docs/self-hosted/observability/tracing\">Tracing</a> is disabled by default, and if you intend to enable it, you will have to deploy and configure the <a class=\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\" href=\"/docs/self-hosted/observability/opentelemetry\">OpenTelemetry Collector</a>.

Upgrading from Postgresql 12 to Postgresql 16 is a manual process, that is similar to the one outlined below for multi-version upgrades, but migrator has been merged into the container, allowing for a simpler upgrade.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: It is highly recommended to <strong>take an up-to-date snapshot of your databases</strong> prior to starting a multi-version upgrade.

{\\n\\tCURRENT_VERSION_STRING_NO_V,\\n\\tCURRENT_VERSION_STRING\\n} from 'src/components/PreCodeBlock';\\n\\n# Docker Single Container Deployment\\n\\nThe Docker Single Container deployment type is a way to very quickly get an instance of Sourcegraph set up locally to experiment with many of its features. However, it is **not recommended** for a production instance, and **has limitations** depending on the OS you are deploying to, as well as the associated resources. See the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for additional information.\\n\\n[Code Insights](/code-insights/) is not supported in Single Container deployments. To try Code Insights you must deploy using [Docker Compose](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-compose/) or [Kubernetes](/self-hosted/deploy/kubernetes/). [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) is disabled by default, and if you intend to enable it, you will have to deploy and configure the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/self-hosted/observability/opentelemetry). The Single Container deployment does not ship with this service included. It is strongly recommended to use one of the aforementioned deployment methods if tracing support is a requirement.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nIt takes less than a minute to run and install Sourcegraph using Docker:\\n\\n```\\ndocker run\\n--publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm\\n--volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph\\n--volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph\\nsourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}\\n```\\n\\nOnce the server is ready (logo is displayed in the terminal), navigate to the hostname or IP address on port `7080`. Create the admin account, then you'll be guided through setting up Sourcegraph for code searching and navigation.\\n\\nFor next steps and further configuration options, review the high-level configuration items below, or visit the [detailed configuration documentation](/admin/).\\n\\n\\u003e WARNING: **We do not recommend using this method for a production instance.** If deploying a production instance, see [our recommendations](/self-hosted/deploy/) for how to choose a deployment type that suits your needs. We recommend [Docker Compose](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-compose/) for most initial production deployments.\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\n### Configure exposed Sourcegraph port\\n\\nChange the `docker` `--publish` argument to make it listen on the specific interface and port on your host machine. For example, `docker run ... --publish 0.0.0.0:80:7080 ...` would make it accessible on port 80 of your machine. For more information, see \\\"[Publish or expose port](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish-or-expose-port--p---expose)\\\" in the Docker documentation.\\n\\nThe other option is to deploy and run Sourcegraph on a cloud provider. For an example, see the [cloud installation section](#cloud-installation-guides).\\n\\n### Git configuration and authentication\\n\\nFor single-container environments, upon the Sourcegraph Docker image container start, it copies all files from `/etc/sourcegraph/{ssh,gitconfig,netrc}` into its own `$HOME` directory, via the `--volume /mnt/sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph` in the `docker run` command.\\n\\nFor example, to mount a `.gitconfig`, create a file `/mnt/sourcegraph/config/gitconfig` on your host containing your configuration:\\n\\n```\\n# example .gitconfig\\n\\n[url \\\"example.url.com:\\\"]\\n  insteadOf = \\\"ssh://example.url.com\\\"\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively you can create a new Docker image which inherits from Sourcegraph and then mutates the environment:\\n\\n```dockerfile\\nFROM sourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}\\n\\nCOPY gitconfig /etc/gitconfig\\nCOPY ssh /root/.ssh\\nRUN\\tfind /root/.ssh -type f -exec chmod 600 '{}' ';'\\nRUN\\tfind /root/.ssh -type d -exec chmod 700 '{}' ';'\\n```\\n\\nThis approach can also be used for `sourcegraph/gitserver` images in cluster environments.\\n\\nLearn more about Git [configuration](/admin/repo/git-config) and [authentication](/admin/repo/auth).\\n\\n#### SSH authentication (config, keys, `known_hosts`)\\n\\nThe container consults its own file system (in the standard locations) for SSH configuration, private keys, and `known_hosts`. Upon container start, it copies all files from `/etc/sourcegraph/ssh` into its own `$HOME/.ssh` directory.\\n\\nTo provide SSH authentication configuration to the container, assuming you're using the default `--volume $HOME/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph`, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Create files at `$HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh/config`, `$HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh/known_hosts`, etc., on the host machine as desired to configure SSH.\\n1. Start (or restart) the container.\\n\\nTo configure the container to use the same SSH as your user account on the host machine, you can also run `cp -R $HOME/.ssh $HOME/.sourcegraph/config/ssh`.\\n\\n#### HTTP(S) authentication via netrc\\n\\nThe easiest way to specify HTTP(S) authentication for repositories is to include the username and password in the clone URL itself, such as `https://user:password@example.com/my/repo`. These credentials won't be displayed to non-admin users.\\n\\nOtherwise, the container consults the `$HOME/.netrc` files on its own file system for HTTP(S) authentication. The `.netrc` file is a standard way to specify authentication used to connect to external hosts.\\n\\nTo provide HTTP(S) authentication, assuming you're using the default `--volume $HOME/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph`, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Create a file at `$HOME/.sourcegraph/config/netrc` on the host machine that contains lines of the form `machine example.com login alice password mypassword` (replacing `example.com`, `alice`, and `mypassword` with the actual values).\\n1. Start (or restart) the container.\\n\\n### Expose debug port\\n\\nThis is required to [collect debug data](/self-hosted/pprof).\\n\\nThe docker run command for single-container Sourcegraph needs an additional publish flag to expose the debug port:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --publish 127.0.0.1:6060:6060 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}\\n```\\n\\nIf Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool\\nsuch as [sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) is required to establish a secure connection.\\nTo access the remote server using `sshuttle` from your local machine:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ sshuttle -r user@host 0/0\\n```\\n\\n### Environment variables\\n\\nAdd the following to your docker run command:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker run [...]\\n-e (YOUR CODE)\\nsourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}\\n```\\n\\n## Operation\\n\\n### Access the database\\n\\n\\u003e NOTE: To execute an SQL query against the database without first creating an interactive session (as below), append `--command \\\"SELECT * FROM users;\\\"` to the `docker container exec` command.\\n\\nGet the Docker container ID for Sourcegraph:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker ps\\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE\\nd039ec989761        sourcegraph/server:VERSION\\n```\\n\\nOpen a PostgreSQL interactive terminal:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker container exec -it d039ec989761 psql -U postgres sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nRun your SQL query:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM users;\\n```\\n\\n## Upgrade\\n\\n### Postgresql 16\\n\\n\\u003e Warning: The 5.11 release updates the database container images from Postgres 12 to Postgres 16. Customers are advised to have a database backup before upgrading! See our [postgres 12 end of life](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/self-hosted/postgres12-end-of-life-notice#postgres-12-end-of-life) notice!\\n\\nFrom sourcegraph version 5.11 onwards, the Sourcegraph single container Docker image uses Postgresql 16. Upgrading from Postgresql 12 to Postgresql 16 is a manual process, that is similar to the one outlined below for multi-version upgrades, but migrator has been merged into the container, allowing for a simpler upgrade.\\n\\n\\u003e NOTE: It is highly recommended to **take an up-to-date snapshot of your databases** prior to starting a multi-version upgrade. The upgrade process aggressively mutates the shape and contents of your database, and undiscovered errors in the migration process or unexpected environmental differences may cause an unusable instance or data loss.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e We recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e **If you do not feel confident running this process solo**, contact customer support team to help guide you thorough the process.\\n\\n**Before performing a multi-version upgrade**:\\n\\n-   Read our [update policy](/self-hosted/updates/#update-policy) to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\\n-   Find the entries that apply to the version range you're passing through in the [update notes for Sourcegraph with Docker Single Container](/self-hosted/updates/server#multi-version-upgrade-procedure).\\n\\n0. You must first shutdown the container instance via `docker stop [CONTAINER]`.\\n1. Start a temporary Postgres container on top of the Postgres data directory used by the old `sourcegraph/server` image. You must use the _new_ postgresql-16-codeinsights image, which is based on the new Postgresql 16 image, and provides an automatic upgrade script to move from Postgresql 12 to Postgresql 16.\\n\\n`docker run --rm -it -v ~/.sourcegraph/data/postgresql:/data/pgdata-12 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres  -p 5432:5432 sourcegraph/postgresql-16-codeinsights:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}`\\n\\n2. Once that temporary container marks that Postgresql has started, the migration is complete and you can stop the temporary container.\\n3. Start the new `sourcegraph/server` container.\\n\\n`docker run --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}`\\n\\nYou now have a single server Sourcegraph container image running on Postgresql 16.\\n\\n### Standard upgrades\\n\\nA [standard upgrade](/self-hosted/updates/#standard-upgrades) occurs between two minor versions of Sourcegraph. If you are looking to jump forward several versions, you must perform a [multi-version upgrade](#multi-version-upgrades) instead.\\n\\n**Before upgrading:**\\n\\n-   Read our [update policy](/self-hosted/updates/#update-policy) to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\\n-   Find the relevant entry for your update in the [update notes for single-container Sourcegraph with Docker](/self-hosted/updates/server).\\n\\nTo update, just use the newer `sourcegraph/server:N.N.N` Docker image (where `N.N.N` is a patch or single minor release away your current version) in place of the older one, using the same Docker volumes. Your server's data will be migrated automatically if needed. You can always find the version number details of the latest release via the [technical changelog](/technical-changelog).\\n\\n### Multi-version upgrades\\n\\n\\u003e NOTE: It is no longer necessary to run Migrator outside of the single instance container. Migrator is now built into the container, and will be run via the `sourcegraph/server` image.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e We **still** recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e The below docs are kept for posterity for users on older versions of Sourcegraph that are looking to upgrade or run the migrator tool.\\n\\nTo update, just use the newer `sourcegraph/server:N.N.N` Docker image in place of the older one, using the same Docker volumes. Your server's data will be migrated automatically if needed. You can always find the version number details of the latest release via the [technical changelog](/technical-changelog).\\n\\n### (Legacy) Multi-version upgrades\\n\\nA [multi-version upgrade](/self-hosted/updates/#multi-version-upgrades) is a downtime-incurring upgrade from version 3.20 or later to any future version. Multi-version upgrades will run both schema and data migrations to ensure the data available from the instance remains available post-upgrade.\\n\\n\\u003e NOTE: It is highly recommended to **take an up-to-date snapshot of your databases** prior to starting a multi-version upgrade. The upgrade process aggressively mutates the shape and contents of your database, and undiscovered errors in the migration process or unexpected environmental differences may cause an unusable instance or data loss.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e We recommend performing the entire upgrade procedure on an idle clone of the production instance and switch traffic over on success, if possible. This may be low-effort for installations with a canary environment or a blue/green deployment strategy.\\n\\u003e\\n\\u003e **If you do not feel confident running this process solo**, contact customer support team to help guide you thorough the process.\\n\\n**Before performing a multi-version upgrade**:\\n\\n-   Read our [update policy](/self-hosted/updates/#update-policy) to learn about Sourcegraph updates.\\n-   Find the entries that apply to the version range you're passing through in the [update notes for Sourcegraph with Docker Single Container](/self-hosted/updates/server#multi-version-upgrade-procedure).\\n\\nTo perform a multi-version upgrade on a Sourcegraph instance running on Docker Single Container:\\n\\n1. Stop the running Sourcegraph container via `docker stop [CONTAINER]`.\\n1. Start a temporary Postgres container on top of the Postgres data directory used by the old `sourcegraph/server` image. This Postgres instance will be used by the following upgrade migration. If using an [external database](/self-hosted/external-services/postgres), the database is already accessible from the `migrator` so no action is needed. Otherwise, start the new Postgres container by following the steps [described below](#running-temporary-postgres-containers).\\n1. Follow the instructions on [how to run the migrator job in Docker](/self-hosted/updates/migrator/migrator-operations#docker-compose) to perform the upgrade migratiohn. For specific documentation on the `upgrade` command, see the [command documentation](/self-hosted/updates/migrator/migrator-operations#upgrade). The following specific steps are an easy way to run the upgrade command:\\n\\n\\u003cp /\\u003e\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker run \\\\\\n  --rm \\\\\\n  --name migrator_${SG_VERSION} \\\\\\n  -e PGHOST='pgsql' \\\\\\n  -e PGPORT='5432' \\\\\\n  -e PGUSER='sg' \\\\\\n  -e PGPASSWORD='sg' \\\\\\n  -e PGDATABASE='sourcegraph' \\\\\\n  -e PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGHOST='pgsql' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGPORT='5432' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGUSER='sg' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGPASSWORD='sg' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGDATABASE='sourcegraph-codeintel' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGHOST='pgsql' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGPORT='5432' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGUSER='postgres' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGPASSWORD='password' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGDATABASE='postgres' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINSIGHTS_PGSSLMODE='disable' \\\\\\n  -e CODEINTEL_PG_ALLOW_SINGLE_DB=true \\\\\\n  sourcegraph/migrator:v${SG_VERSION} \\\\\\n  upgrade --from=${CURRENT_SG_VERSION} --to=${SG_VERSION}\\n```\\n\\nIt is recommended to also add the `--dry-run` flag on a trial invocation to detect if there are any issues with database connection, schema drift, or mismatched versions that need to be addressed.\\n\\nAfter this container exits successfully, the remaining infrastructure can now be updated. All temporary containers can be stopped, and the Docker invocation for your `sourcegraph/server` container can be updated to use the new target version.\\n\\n#### Running temporary Postgres containers\\n\\nMounting a Postgres container on top of the data directory used by `sourcegraph/server` will allow us to access and migrate the data in-place without having running services interfere.\\n\\nLet `${PATH}` be the directory mounted into `/var/opt/sourcegraph` of your instance. This mount contains the Postgres data directory inside of the container.\\n\\nFor example, `${PATH}` is `~/.sourcegraph/data` in `-v ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph`.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker run --rm -it \\\\\\n  -v ${PATH}/postgresql:/data/pgdata-12 \\\\\\n  -u 70 \\\\\\n  -p 5432:5432 \\\\\\n  --entrypoint bash \\\\\\n  sourcegraph/${PG_VERSION_TAG}:${SG_VERSION} \\\\\\n  -c 'echo \\\"host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust\\\" \\u003e\\u003e /data/pgdata-12/pg_hba.conf \\u0026\\u0026 postgres -c l listen_addresses=\\\"*\\\" -D /data/pgdata-12'\\n```\\n\\nThe version of this Postgres container is dependent on the version of the instance prior to upgrade.\\n\\n| `${SG_VERSION}`     | `${PG_VERSION_TAG}`    |\\n| ------------------- | ---------------------- |\\n| `3.20.X` - `3.29.X` | `postgres-12.6`        |\\n| `3.30.X` - `3.37.X` | `postgres-12.6-alpine` |\\n| `3.38.X` - `5.9.X`  | `postgres-12-alpine`   |\\n| `5.10.X` -          | `postgresql-16`        |\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf you get stuck or need help, please reach out to [Sourcegraph support](https://help.sourcegraph.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\\n\\n### Mac Computers with Apple silicon\\n\\nOn Mac computers with Apple silicon, you’ll need to add an extra `--platform linux/amd64` argument to your Docker command for correctly running and installing Sourcegraph.\\n\\n### File system performance on Docker for Mac\\n\\nThere is a [known issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77) in Docker for Mac that causes slower than expected file system performance on volume mounts, which impacts the performance of search and cloning.\\n\\nTo achieve better performance, you can do any of the following:\\n\\n-   For better clone performance, clone the repository on your host machine and then [add it to Sourcegraph Server](/admin/repo/add#add-repositories-already-cloned-to-disk).\\n-   Try adding the `:delegated` suffix the data volume mount. [Learn more](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1592).\\n    ```sh\\n    --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph:delegated\\n    ```\\n\\n### Testing Sourcegraph on Windows\\n\\nSourcegraph can be **tested** on Windows 10 using roughly the same steps provided above, but data will not be retained after server restarts ([this is due to a limitation of Docker on Windows](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/39#issuecomment-371942845)).\\n\\n1. [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)\\n2. Using a command prompt, follow the same [installation steps provided above](#install-sourcegraph-with-docker) but remove the `--volume` arguments. For example by pasting this:\\n\\n\\u003cpre class=\\\"pre-wrap\\\"\\u003e\\n\\t\\u003ccode\\u003e\\n\\t\\tdocker run\\u003cspan class=\\\"virtual-br\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e --publish 7080:7080 --publish\\n\\t\\t127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm\\u003cspan class=\\\"virtual-br\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/span\\u003e{' '}\\n\\t\\tsourcegraph/server:{CURRENT_VERSION_STRING_NO_V()}\\n\\t\\u003c/code\\u003e\\n\\u003c/pre\\u003e\\n\\n### Low resource environments\\n\\nTo test Sourcegraph in a low resource environment you may want to disable some of the observability tools (Prometheus and Grafana).\\n\\nAdd `-e DISABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true` to your docker run command.\\n\\n### Starting in Postgres restore mode\\n\\nIn order to restore a Postgres backup, you need to start on an empty database and prevent all other Sourcegraph services from starting.\\nYou can do this by adding `-e PGRESTORE=true` to your `docker run` command. This will start only the Postgres system and allow you to perform a restore. Once it is done, remove that parameter from your docker command.\\n\\nThe database is only accessible from within the container. To perform a restore you will need to copy the required files to the container and then execute the restore commands from within the container using `docker exec`.\\n\\nYou can find examples of this procedure for `docker-compose` in our [docker-compose migration docs](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-compose/migrate).\\n\\n### Special instructions for RHEL, Fedora, CentOS and others\\n\\nIf you run Docker on an OS such as RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS with SELinux enabled, sVirt doesn't allow the Docker process to access `~/.sourcegraph/config` and `~/.sourcegraph/data`. In that case, you will see the following message:\\n\\n`Failed to setup nginx:failed to generate nginx configuration to /etc/sourcegraph: open /etc/sourcegraph/nginx.conf: permission denied`.\\n\\nTo fix this, run:\\n\\n`mkdir -p ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data \\u0026\\u0026 chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data`\\n\\n## Reference\\n\\n### Cloud installation guides\\n\\nCloud specific Sourcegraph installation guides for AWS, Google Cloud and Digital Ocean.\\n\\n-   [Install Sourcegraph with Docker on AWS](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container/aws)\\n-   [Install Sourcegraph with Docker on Google Cloud](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container/google-cloud)\\n-   [Install Sourcegraph with Docker on DigitalOcean](/self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container/digitalocean)\\n\\n### Insiders build\\n\\nTo test new development builds of Sourcegraph (triggered by commits to `main`), change the tag to `insiders` in the `docker run` command.\\n\\n\\u003e WARNING: `insiders` builds may be unstable, so back up Sourcegraph's data and config (usually `~/.sourcegraph`) beforehand.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ docker run --publish 7080:7080 --rm --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph sourcegraph/server:insiders\\n```\\n\\nTo keep this up to date, run `docker pull sourcegraph/server:insiders` to pull in the latest image, and restart the container to access new changes.\\n\"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,\"72:[\\\"slug\\\",\\\"self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container\\\",\\\"c\\\"]\\n7b:[]\\n\"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,\"0:[\\\"$\\\",\\\"$L7\\\",null,{\\\"buildId\\\":\\\"nbqJZLrUkI7_tmilG39ET\\\",\\\"assetPrefix\\\":\\\"/docs\\\",\\\"urlParts\\\":[\\\"\\\",\\\"self-hosted\\\",\\\"deploy\\\",\\\"docker-single-container\\\"],\\\"initialTree\\\":[\\\"\\\",{\\\"children\\\":[[\\\"slug\\\",\\\"self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container\\\",\\\"c\\\"],{\\\"children\\\":[\\\"__PAGE__\\\",{}]}]},\\\"$undefined\\\",\\\"$undefined\\\",true],\\\"initialSeedData\\\":[\\\"\\\",{\\\"children\\\":[[\\\"slug\\\",\\\"self-hosted/deploy/docker-single-container\\\",\\\"c\\\"],{\\\"children\\\":[\\\"__PAGE__\\\",{},[[\\\"$L8\\\",[[\\\"$\\\",\\\"div\\\",null,{\\\"className\\\":\\\"min-w-0 max-w-2xl flex-auto px-4 py-16 lg:max-w-none lg:pl-8 lg:pr-0 xl:px-16\\\",\\\"children\\\":[[\\\"$\\\",\\\"$L9\\\",null,{\\\"path\\\":[\\\"self-hosted\\\",\\\"deploy\\\",\\\"docker-single-container\\\"]}],[\\\"$\\\",\\\"article\\\",null,{\\\"children\\\":[\\\"$\\\",\\\"div\\\",null,{\\\"className\\\":\\\"$a\\\",\\\"children\\\":[[\\\"$\\\",\\\"h1\\\",null,{\\\"id\\\":\\\"docker-single-container-deployment\\\",\\\"children\\\":[[\\\"$\\\",\\\"a\\\",null,{\\\"href\\\":\\\"#docker-single-container-deployment\\\",\\\"aria-hidden\\\":\\\"true\\\",\\\"tabIndex\\\":\\\"-1\\\",\\\"className\\\":\\\"text-vermilion-00 underline hover:text-[#606060] dark:text-vermilion-11 dark:hover:text-dark-text-secondary\\\",\\\"children\\\":[\\\"$\\\",\\\"span\\\",null,{\\\"className\\\":\\\"icon icon-link\\\"}]}],\\\"Docker Single Container Deployment\\\"]}],\\\"\\\\n\\\",[\\\"$\\\",\\\"p\\\",null,{\\\"children\\\":[\\\"The Docker Single Container deployment type is a way to very quickly get an instance of Sourcegraph set up locally to experiment with many of its features.
