Helm offers a simple deployment process on Kubernetes using well known and standard tooling.\n\nRequirements\nHelm 3 CLI\nKubernetes 1.19 or greater\nConfiguration\n\nGoogle GKE\n\nAWS EKS\n\nAzure AKS\n\nOther or on-prem\n\nUpgrading\n\nWhy use Helm\n\nOur Helm chart has a lot of sensible defaults baked into the values.yaml so that when an override file is used to make the changes, you never have to deal with merge conflicts during upgrades (see more about customizations in the configuration section).\n\nHigh-level overview of how to use Helm with Sourcegraph\nPrepare any required customizations\nMost environments will likely require some customizations to the default Helm chart values. See Configuration for more information.\nAdditionally, resource allocations for individual services may need to be adjusted. See our Resource Estimator for more information.\nReview the customized Helm chart\nThere are three mechanisms that can be used to review any customizations made, this is an optional step, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\nFollow the relevant platform-specific guide below to deploy Sourcegraph to your environment:\nGoogle GKE\nAWS EKS\nAzure AKS\nOther cloud providers or on-prem\nQuickstart\n\nThis quickstart guide is useful to those already familiar with Helm who have a good understanding of how to use Helm in the environment they want to deploy into, and who just want to quickly deploy Sourcegraph with Helm with the default configuration. If this doesn't cover what you need to know, see the links above for platform-specific guides.\n\nTo use the Helm chart, add the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\n\nSH\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\n\nInstall the Sourcegraph chart using default values:\n\nSH\n$ helm install --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nSourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\n\nMore information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here: Configuring Sourcegraph\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe Sourcegraph Helm chart is highly customizable to support a wide range of environments. We highly recommend that customizations be applied using an override file, which allows customizations to persist through upgrades without needing to manage merge conflicts.\n\nThe default configuration values can be viewed in the values.yaml file along with all supported options.\n\nTo customize configuration settings with an override file, begin by creating an empty yaml file (e.g. override.yaml).\n\n(The configuration override file can be created in advance of deployment, and the configuration override settings can be populated in preparation.)\n\nIt's recommended that the override file be maintained in a version control system such as GitHub, but for testing, this can be created on the machine from which the Helm deployment commands will be run.\n\nDO NOT copy the default values file as a boilerplate for your override file. You risk having outdated values during future upgrades. Instead, only include the configuration that you need to change and override.\n\nExample overrides can be found in the examples folder. Please take a look at our examples – feel free to copy and adapt them for your own override file.\n\nProviding the override file to Helm is done with the inclusion of the values flag and the name of the file:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nWhen making configuration changes, it's recommended to review the changes that will be applied—see Reviewing Changes.\n\nSpecific Configuration Scenarios\nUsing external PostgreSQL databases\n\nTo use external PostgreSQL databases, first review our general recommendations and required postgres permissions.\n\nWe recommend storing the credentials in Secrets created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner. Each database requires its own Secret and should follow the following format. The Secret name can be customized as desired:\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: pgsql-credentials\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    database: ''\n    host: '' # example: pgsql.database.example.com\n    password: ''\n    port: ''\n    user: ''\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: codeintel-db-credentials\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    database: ''\n    host: ''\n    password: ''\n    port: ''\n    user: ''\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: codeinsights-db-credentials\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    database: ''\n    host: ''\n    password: ''\n    port: ''\n    user: ''\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\n\nThe above Secrets should be deployed to the same namespace as the existing Sourcegraph deployment.\n\nYou can reference the Secrets in your override.yaml by configuring the existingSecret key:\n\nYAML\ncodeIntelDB:\n    enabled: false # disables deployment of the database\n    auth:\n        existingSecret: codeintel-db-credentials\n \ncodeInsightsDB:\n    enabled: false\n    auth:\n        existingSecret: codeinsights-db-credentials\n \npgsql:\n    enabled: false\n    auth:\n        existingSecret: pgsql-credentials\n\nThe using external databases example demonstrates this approach.\n\nAlthough not recommended, credentials can also be configured directly in the helm chart. For example, add the following to your override.yaml to customize pgsql credentials:\n\nYAML\npgsql:\n    enabled: false # Disable internal pgsql database\n    auth:\n        database: 'custom-db'\n        host: pgsql.database.company.com # External pgsql host\n        user: 'new-user'\n        password: 'new-password'\n        port: '5432'\n        sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\nUsing external Redis instances\n\nTo use external Redis instances, first review our general recommendations.\n\nIf your external Redis instances do not require authentication, you can configure access in your override.yaml with the endpoint settings:\n\nYAML\nredisCache:\n    enabled: false\n    connection:\n        endpoint: redis://redis-cache.example.com:6379 # use a dedicated Redis, recommended\n \nredisStore:\n    enabled: false\n    connection:\n        endpoint: redis://redis-shared.example.com:6379/2 # shared Redis, not recommended\n\nIf your endpoints do require authentication, we recommend storing the credentials in Secrets created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner.\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: redis-cache-connection\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    endpoint: ''\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: redis-store-connection\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    endpoint: ''\n\nYou can reference this secret in your override.yaml by configuring the existingSecret key:\n\nYAML\nredisCache:\n    enabled: false\n    connection:\n        existingSecret: redis-cache-connection\n \nredisStore:\n    enabled: false\n    connection:\n        existingSecret: redis-store-connection\n\nThe using your own Redis example demonstrates this approach.\n\nUsing external Object Storage\n\nTo use an external Object Storage service (S3-compatible services, or GCS), first review our general recommendations. Then review the following example and adjust to your use case.\n\nSee override.yaml for an example override file. The example assumes the use of AWS S3. You may configure the environment variables accordingly for your own use case based on our general recommendations.\n\nIf you provide credentials with an access key / secret key, we recommend storing the credentials in Secrets created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner. An example Secret is shown here:\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ''\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ''\n\nIn your override.yaml, reference this Secret and the necessary environment variables:\n\nYAML\nblobstore:\n    enabled: false # Disable deployment of the built-in object storage\n \n# we use YAML anchors and alias to keep override file clean\nobjectStorageEnv: &objectStorageEnv\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BACKEND:\n        value: S3 # external object storage type, one of \"S3\" or \"GCS\"\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BUCKET:\n        value: lsif-uploads # external object storage bucket name\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ENDPOINT:\n        value: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_REGION:\n        value: us-east-1\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:\n        secretKeyRef: # Pre-existing secret, not created by this chart\n            name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\n            key: PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:\n        secretKeyRef: # Pre-existing secret, not created by this chart\n            name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\n            key: PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n \nfrontend:\n    env:\n        <<: *objectStorageEnv\n \npreciseCodeIntel:\n    env:\n        <<: *objectStorageEnv\nUsing SSH to clone repositories\n\nCreate a Secret that contains the base64 encoded contents of your SSH private key (make sure it doesn't require a passphrase) and known_hosts file. The [Secret] will be mounted in the gitserver deployment to authenticate with your code host.\n\nIf you have access to the ssh keys locally, you can run the command below to create the secret:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl create secret generic gitserver-ssh \\\n    --from-file id_rsa=${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa \\\n    --from-file known_hosts=${HOME}/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nAlternatively, you may manually create the secret from a manifest file.\n\nDo NOT commit the secret manifest into your Git repository unless you are okay with storing sensitive information in plaintext and your repository is private.\n\nCreate a file with the following and save it as gitserver-ssh.Secret.yaml\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: gitserver-ssh\ndata:\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\n    id_rsa: ''\n    known_hosts: ''\n\nApply the created [Secret] with the command below:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl apply -f gitserver-ssh.Secret.yaml\n\nYou should add the following values to your override file to reference the [Secret] you created earlier.\n\nYAML\ngitserver:\n    sshSecret: gitserver-ssh\nAdvanced Configuration Methods\n\nThe Helm chart is new and still under active development, and our values.yaml (and therefore the customization available to use via an override file) may not cover every need. Equally, some changes are environment or customer-specific, and so will never be part of the default Sourcegraph Helm chart.\n\nThe following guidance for using Kustomize with Helm and Helm Subcharts covers both of these scenarios.\n\nWhile both of these approaches are available, deployment changes that are not covered by Sourcegraph documentation should be discussed with either your Customer Engineer or Support contact before proceeding, to ensure the changes proposed can be supported by Sourcegraph. This also allows Sourcegraph to consider adding the required customizations to the Helm chart.\n\nIntegrate Kustomize with Helm chart\n\nFor advanced users who are looking for a temporary workaround, we recommend applying Kustomize on the rendered manifests from our chart. Please do not maintain your own fork of our chart, this may impact our ability to support you if you run into issues.\n\nYou can learn more about how to integrate Kustomize with Helm from our example.\n\nHelm subcharts\n\nHelm subcharts can be used for permanent customizations to the official Sourcegraph helm chart. This is useful for changes such as adding a new resource unique to your deployment (PodSecurityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, additional services, etc.). These are long-lived customizations that shouldn't be contributed back to the Sourcegraph helm chart.\n\nWith a subchart, you create your own helm chart and specify the Sourcegraph chart as a dependency. Any resources you place in the templates folder of your chart will be deployed, as well as the Sourcegraph resources, allowing you to extend the Sourcegraph chart without maintaining a fork.\n\nAn example of a subchart is shown in the examples/subchart folder.\n\nMore details on how to create and configure a subchart can be found in the helm documentation.\n\nTracing\n\nSourcegraph supports HTTP tracing to help troubleshoot issues. See Tracing for details.\n\nTo enable tracing on your Helm instance, you'll need to either:\n\nDeploy our bundled Jaeger backend, or\nConfigure an external tracing backend\n\nOnce a tracing backend has been deployed, see our Tracing page for next steps, including required changes to your Site Configuration to enable traces.\n\nEnable the bundled Jaeger deployment\n\nSourcegraph bundles a Jaeger instance, but it is disabled by default. You can enable it by either adding this to your Helm values override file, or by appending the jaeger/override.yaml file to your Helm upgrade command.\n\nYAML\njaeger:\n    enabled: true\nConfigure OpenTelemetry Collector to use an external tracing backend\n\nTo configure the bundled otel-collector to export traces to an external OTel-compatible backend, you you can customize the otel-collector's config file directly in your Helm values override.yaml file.\n\nFor the specific configurations to set, see our OpenTelemetry page.\n\nYAML\nopenTelemetry:\n    gateway:\n        config:\n            traces:\n                exporters:\n                    # Your exporter configuration here\n                processors:\n                    # Your processor configuration here\n\nTo use an external Jaeger instance, copy and customize the configs from the opentelemetry-exporter/override.yaml file, and add them to your Helm values override file:\n\nYAML\nopenTelemetry:\n    gateway:\n        env:\n            JAEGER_HOST:\n                value: 'http://your.jaeger.endpoint'\n        config:\n            traces:\n                exporters:\n                    jaeger:\n                        endpoint: '$JAEGER_HOST:14250'\n                        tls:\n                            insecure: true\nConfigure a tracing backend with TLS enabled\n\nIf you require a TLS connection to export trace data, you need to first add the certificate data to a secret. The following snippet demonstrates how you can achieve this:\n\nDo NOT commit the secret manifest into your Git repository unless you are okay with storing sensitive information in plaintext and your repository is private.\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: otel-collector-exporters-tls\ndata:\n    file.cert: '<.cert data>'\n    file.key: '<.key data>'\n\nAfter applying the secret to your cluster, you can use the opentelemetry-exporter/override-tls.yaml example, and configure the value openTelemetry.gateway.config.traces.exportersTlsSecretName in your Helm values override file to mount the certificate data in the otel-collector, and instruct the exporter to use TLS:\n\nYAML\nopenTelemetry:\n    gateway:\n        env:\n            JAEGER_HOST:\n                value: 'http://your.jaeger.endpoint'\n        config:\n            traces:\n                exportersTlsSecretName: otel-collector-exporters-tls\n                exporters:\n                    jaeger:\n                        endpoint: '$JAEGER_HOST:14250'\n                        tls:\n                            cert_file: /tls/file.cert\n                            key_file: /tls/file.key\nConfigure trace sampling\n\nReview the trace sampling documentation, and the opentelemetry-exporter/override-processor.yaml example, then add the configs to your Helm values override file:\n\nYAML\nopenTelemetry:\n    gateway:\n        config:\n            traces:\n                processors:\n                    probabilistic_sampler:\n                        hash_seed: 22 # An integer used to compute the hash algorithm. Note that all collectors for a given tier (e.g. behind the same load balancer) should have the same hash_seed.\n                        sampling_percentage: 10.0 # (default = 0): Percentage at which traces are sampled; >= 100 samples all traces\nCloud providers guides\n\nThis section is aimed at providing high-level guidance on deploying Sourcegraph via Helm on major Cloud providers. In general, you need the following to get started:\n\nA working Kubernetes cluster, v1.19 or higher\nThe ability to provision persistent volumes, e.g. have Block Storage CSI storage driver installed\nAn Ingress Controller installed, e.g. platform native ingress controller, NGINX Ingress Controller.\nThe ability to create DNS records for Sourcegraph, e.g. sourcegraph.company.com\nConfigure Sourcegraph on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nPrerequisites\nYou need to have a GKE cluster (>=1.19) with the HTTP Load Balancing addon enabled. Alternatively, you can use your own choice of Ingress Controller and disable the HTTP Load Balancing add-on, learn more.\nYour account should have sufficient access rights, equivalent to the cluster-admin ClusterRole.\nConnect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using gcloud) and ensure the cluster is up and running by running: kubectl get nodes (several ready nodes should be listed)\nHave the Helm CLI installed and run the following command to link to the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\n\nPlease note that Autopilot clusters are not supported. Google managed clusters have security constraints that prevent the setup of the Sourcegraph services.\n\nSH\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\nSteps\n\nStep 1: – Create your override file and add in any configuration override settings you need—see configuration for more information on override files and the options for what can be configured.\n\nAdd into your override file the below values to configure both your ingress hostname and your storage class. We recommend configuring Ingress to use Container-native load balancing to expose Sourcegraph publicly on a domain of your choosing and setting the Storage Class to use Compute Engine persistent disk. (For an example file see override.yaml)\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    serviceType: ClusterIP\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce\n    # To enable HTTPS using a self-managed certificate\n    #    tlsSecret: example-secret\n    #    host: sourcegraph.example.com\n    serviceAnnotations:\n        cloud.google.com/neg: '{\"ingress\": true}'\n        # Reference the `BackendConfig` CR created below\n        beta.cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{\"default\": \"sourcegraph-frontend\"}'\n \nstorageClass:\n    create: true\n    type: pd-ssd # This configures SSDs (recommended).\n    provisioner: pd.csi.storage.gke.io\n    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\n    reclaimPolicy: Retain\n \nextraResources:\n    - apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1\n      kind: BackendConfig\n      metadata:\n          name: sourcegraph-frontend\n      spec:\n          healthCheck:\n              checkIntervalSec: 5\n              timeoutSec: 5\n              requestPath: /ready\n              port: 6060 # we use a custom port to perform healthcheck\n\nThe override file includes a BackendConfig CRD. This is necessary to instruct the GCP load balancer on how to perform health checks on our deployment.\n\nContainer-native load balancing is only available on VPC-native clusters. For legacy clusters, learn more.\n\nOptionally, you can review the changes using one of three mechanisms that can be used to assess the customizations made. This is not required, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\n\nStep 2: – Install the chart\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nIt will take around 10 minutes for the load balancer to be fully ready, you may check on the status and obtain the load balancer IP using the following command:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend\n\nStep 3: – Upon obtaining the allocated IP address of the load balancer, you should create a DNS A record for the sourcegraph.company.com domain. Finally, it is recommended to enable TLS and you may consider using Google-managed certificate in GKE or your own certificate.\n\nIf using a GKE manage certificate, add the following annotations to Ingress:\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: null\n            networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: managed-cert # replace with actual Google-managed certificate name\n            # if you reserve a static IP, uncomment below and update ADDRESS_NAME\n            # also, make changes to your DNS record accordingly\n            # kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: ADDRESS_NAME\n\nIf using your own certificate, you can do so with TLS Secrets.\n\nStep 4: Create a file with the following and save it as sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: sourcegraph-frontend-tls\ntype: kubernetes.io/tls\ndata:\n    # the data is abbreviated in this example\n    tls.crt: |\n        MIIC2DCCAcCgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqh ...\n    tls.key: |\n        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA7yn3bRHQ5FHMQ ...\nSH\n$ kubectl apply -f ./sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml\n\nAdd the following values to your override file.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce\n        tlsSecret: sourcegraph-frontend-tls # reference the created TLS Secret\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n\nStep 5 – Validate the deployment Sourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\n\nStep 6 – Further configuration\n\nNow the deployment is complete. More information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here: Configuring Sourcegraph\n\nConfigure Sourcegraph on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\nPrerequisites\nYou need to have a EKS cluster (>=1.19) with the following addons enabled:\nAWS Load Balancer Controller\nAWS EBS CSI driver\n\nYou may consider deploying your own Ingress Controller instead of the ALB Ingress Controller, learn more\n\nYour account should have sufficient access equivalent to the cluster-admin ClusterRole.\nConnect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using eksctl) and ensure the cluster is up and running using: kubectl get nodes (several ready nodes should be listed)\nHave the Helm CLI installed and run the following command to link to the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\nSH\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\nSteps\n\nStep 1: – Create your override file and add in any configuration override settings you need—see configuration for more information on override files and the options around what can be configured.\n\nWe recommend adding the following values into your override file to configure Ingress to use AWS Load Balancer Controller to expose Sourcegraph publicly on a domain of your choosing, and to configure the Storage Class to use AWS EBS CSI driver. For an example, see override.yaml.\n\nUncomment the provisioner that your Amazon EKS cluster implements.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip # specifies targeting services with type ClusterIP\n            # By default the AWS ALB will be internal to your VPC.\n            #  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing  # use this annotation if you plan to provision a public Sourcegraph URL.\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb # aws load balancer controller ingressClass name\n            # additional aws alb ingress controller supported annotations\n            # ...\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n \nstorageClass:\n    create: true\n    type: gp2 # This configures SSDs (recommended).\n    #  provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com # use this provisioner if using the self-managed Amazon EBS Container Storage Interface driver\n    #  provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs # use this provisioner if using the Amazon EKS add-on\n    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\n    reclaimPolicy: Retain\n\nOptionally, you can review the changes using one of three mechanisms that can be used to assess the customizations made. This is not required, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\n\nStep 2: – Install the chart\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nIt will take some time for the load balancer to be fully ready, use the following to check on the status and obtain the load balancer address (once available):\n\nSH\n$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend\n\nStep 3: – Upon obtaining the allocated address of the load balancer, you should create a DNS record for the sourcegraph.company.com domain that resolves to the load balancer address.\n\nIt is recommended to enable TLS and configure a certificate properly on your load balancer. You may consider using an AWS-managed certificate and add the following annotations to Ingress.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb\n            # ARN of the AWS-managed TLS certificate\n            alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:xxxxx:certificate/xxxxxxx\n\nStep 4: – Validate the deployment Sourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\n\nStep 5: – Further configuration\n\nNow the deployment is complete. More information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here: Configuring Sourcegraph\n\nReferences\nEnable TLS with AWS-managed certificate\nSupported AWS load balancer annotations\nConfigure Sourcegraph on Azure Managed Kubernetes Service (AKS)\nPrerequisites\nYou need to have an AKS cluster (>=1.19) with the following addons enabled:\nAzure Application Gateway Ingress Controller\nAzure Disk CSI driver\n\nYou may consider using your custom Ingress Controller instead of Application Gateway, learn more.\n\nYour account should have sufficient access equivalent to the cluster-admin ClusterRole.\nConnect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using the Azure CLI) and ensure the cluster is up and running using: kubectl get nodes (several ready nodes should be listed)\nHave the Helm CLI installed and run the following command to link to the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\nSH\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\nSteps\n\nStep 1: – Create your override file and add in any configuration override settings you need—see configuration for more information on override files and the options around what can be configured.\n\nAdd into your override file the below values to configure both your ingress hostname and your storage class. We recommend configuring Ingress to use Application Gateway to expose Sourcegraph publicly on a domain of your choosing and Storage Class to use Azure Disk CSI driver. For an example see override.yaml.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway\n            # additional azure application gateway supported annotations\n            # ...\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n \nstorageClass:\n    create: true\n    type: null\n    provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com\n    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\n    reclaimPolicy: Retain\n    parameters:\n        storageaccounttype: Premium_LRS # This configures SSDs (recommended). A Premium VM is required.\n\nOptionally, you can review the changes using one of three mechanisms that can be used to assess the customizations made. This is not required, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\n\nStep 2: – Install the chart\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nIt will take some time for the load balancer to be fully ready, you can check on the status and obtain the load balancer address (when ready) using:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend\n\nStep 3: – Upon obtaining the allocated address of the load balancer, you should create a DNS record for the sourcegraph.company.com domain that resolves to the load balancer address.\n\nIt is recommended to enable TLS and configure the certificate properly on your load balancer. You may consider using an Azure-managed certificate and add the following annotations to Ingress.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway\n            # Name of the Azure-managed TLS certificate\n            appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/appgw-ssl-certificate: azure-key-vault-managed-ssl-cert\n\nStep 4: – Validate the deployment Sourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\n\nStep 5: – Further configuration\n\nNow the deployment is complete. More information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here: Configuring Sourcegraph\n\nReferences\nExpose an AKS service over HTTP or HTTPS using Application Gateway\nSupported Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller annotations\nWhat is Application Gateway Ingress Controller?\nConfigure Sourcegraph on other Cloud providers or on-prem\nPrerequisites\nYou need to have a Kubernetes cluster (>=1.19) with the following components installed:\n Ingress Controller, e.g. Cloud providers-native solution, NGINX Ingress Controller\n Block Storage CSI driver\nYour account should have sufficient access privileges, equivalent to the cluster-admin ClusterRole.\nConnect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using the relevant CLI tool) and ensure the cluster is up and running using: kubectl get nodes (several ready nodes should be listed)\nHave the Helm CLI installed and run the following command to link to the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\nSH\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\nSteps\n\nStep 1: – Create your override file and add in any configuration override settings you need—see configuration for more information on override files and the options around what can be configured.\n\nRead to configure the storageClass.provisioner and storageClass.parameters fields for your cloud provider or consult documentation of the storage solution in your on-prem environment.\n\nThe following will need to be included in your override.yaml, once adapted to your environment.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ingress-class-name # replace with actual ingress class name\n            # additional ingress controller supported annotations\n            # ...\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n \nstorageClass:\n    create: true\n    provisioner: <REPLACE_ME>\n    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\n    reclaimPolicy: Retain\n    parameters:\n        key1: value1\n\nOptionally, you can review the changes using one of three mechanisms that can be used to assess the customizations made. This is not required, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\n\nStep 2: – Install the chart\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nIt may take some time before your ingress is up and ready to proceed. Depending on how your Ingress Controller works, you may be able to check on its status and obtain the public address of your Ingress using:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend\n\nStep 3: – You should create a DNS record for the sourcegraph.company.com domain that resolves to the Ingress public address.\n\nIt is recommended to enable TLS and configure a certificate properly on your Ingress. You can utilize managed certificate solutions provided by Cloud providers, or your own method.\n\nAlternatively, you may consider configuring cert-manager with Let's Encrypt in your cluster and add the following override to Ingress.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ingress-class-name # replace with actual ingress class name\n            # additional ingress controller supported annotations\n            # ...\n            # cert-managed annotations\n            cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt # replace with actual cluster-issuer name\n        tlsSecret: sourcegraph-frontend-tls # cert-manager will store the created certificate in this secret.\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n\nYou also have the option to manually configure TLS certificate via TLS Secrets.\n\nCreate a file with the following and save it as sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml\n\nYAML\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n    name: sourcegraph-frontend-tls\ntype: kubernetes.io/tls\ndata:\n    # the data is abbreviated in this example\n    tls.crt: |\n        MIIC2DCCAcCgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqh ...\n    tls.key: |\n        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA7yn3bRHQ5FHMQ ...\nSH\n$ kubectl apply -f ./sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml\n\nAdd the following values to your override file.\n\nYAML\nfrontend:\n    ingress:\n        enabled: true\n        annotations:\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ingress-class-name # replace with actual ingress class name\n            # additional ingress controller supported annotations\n            # ...\n        tlsSecret: sourcegraph-frontend-tls # reference the created TLS Secret\n        # replace with your actual domain\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\n\nStep 4: – Validate the deployment Sourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\n\nStep 5: – Further configuration\n\nNow the deployment is complete. More information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here: Configuring Sourcegraph\n\nUpgrading Sourcegraph\n\nThe following procedures describe the process to update a Helm Sourcegraph instance. If you are unfamiliar with sourcegraph versioning or releases see our general concepts documentation.\n\nAlways consult the release notes for the versions your upgrade will pass over and end on.\n\nStandard upgrades\n\nA standard upgrade occurs between a Sourcegraph version and the minor or major version released immediately after it. If you would like to jump forward several versions, you must perform a multi-version upgrade instead.\n\nStep 1: Review Helm Changelog and Sourcegraph Changelog and select the most recent version compatible with your current Sourcegraph version.\n\nYou can only upgrade one minor version of Sourcegraph at a time.\n\nStep 2: Update your copy of the Sourcegraph Helm repo to ensure you have all the latest versions:\n\nSH\n$ helm repo update sourcegraph\n\nStep 3: (Optional) Review the changes that will be applied—see Reviewing Changes for options.\n\nStep 4: Install the new version:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install -f override.yaml --version 6.11.2752 sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\n\nStep 5: Verify the installation has started:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl get pods --watch\n\nWhen all pods have restarted and show as Running, you can browse to your Sourcegraph deployment and login to verify the instance is working as expected. For troubleshooting, refer to the Operations guide for common commands to gather more information about failures.\n\nMulti-version upgrades\n\nPlease see our cautionary note on upgrades, if you have any concerns about running a multi-version upgrade, please reach out to us at support@sourcegraph.com for advisement.\n\nMulti-version upgrade procedure\n\nStep 1: Check Upgrade Readiness:\n\nCheck the upgrade notes for the version range you're passing through.\nCheck the Site Admin > Updates page to determine upgrade readiness.\n\nStep 2:\n\nThe Kubernetes Helm deployment type does not support MVU from Sourcegraph v5.9.45 versions and earlier to ANY version v6.0.x or later. Admins seeking to upgrade to any Sourcegraph version v6.0.x or later (including v6.1.x, v6.2.x, etc.) must first upgrade to v5.10.3940 or v5.11.6271 and then use the standard upgrade procedure to get to their target version. This is because migrator in all versions from v6.0.0 onwards will no longer connect to Postgres 12 databases. For more info see our PostgreSQL upgrade docs.\n\nScale down deployments and statefulSets that access the database, this step prevents services from accessing the database while schema migrations are in process. The following services must have their replicas scaled to 0:\n\nDeployments (e.g., kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=0)\nprecise-code-intel-worker\nsearcher\nsourcegraph-frontend\nsourcegraph-frontend-internal\nworker\nStateful sets (e.g., kubectl scale sts <name> --replicas=0):\ngitserver\nindexed-search\n\nThe following convenience commands provide an example of scaling down the necessary services in a single command:\n\nDeployments:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl get -n sourcegraph deploy --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 -P 8 -I % kubectl -n sourcegraph scale deployment % --replicas=0\n\nStatefulSets:\n\nSH\n$ kubectl -n sourcegraph get sts --selector 'app.kubernetes.io/component!=codeinsights-db,app.kubernetes.io/component!=codeintel-db,app.kubernetes.io/component!=pgsql' --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 -P 8 -I % kubectl -n sourcegraph scale sts % --replicas=0\n\nThe commands above use the sourcegraph namespace and are specific to the kubernetes-helm deployment.\n\nStep 3: Run the migrator upgrade command\n\nThe following command is the general template for running an upgrade\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install -n <your namespace> --set \"migrator.args={upgrade,--from=<current version>,--to=<version to upgrade to>}\" sourcegraph-migrator sourcegraph/sourcegraph-migrator --version <migrator image version>\n\nThe command above is general and you'll need to substitute in your own namespace, target sourcegraph version, and desired migrator image version. In general run the most recent version of migrator.\n\nExample:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install -n sourcegraph --set \"migrator.args={upgrade,--from=3.41.0,--to=4.5.1}\" sourcegraph-migrator sourcegraph/sourcegraph-migrator --version 6.11.2752\nRelease \"sourcegraph-migrator\" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!\nNAME: sourcegraph-migrator\nLAST DEPLOYED: Tue Mar  7 18:23:56 2023\nNAMESPACE: sourcegraph\nSTATUS: deployed\nREVISION: 2\nTEST SUITE: None\n✅ Out of band migrations complete\n👉 Migrating to v4.5 (step 3 of 3)\n👉 Running schema migrations\n✅ Schema migrations complete\n\n\nYou can learn more about running migrator operations in helm in the migrator operations doc.\n\nStep 4: Upgrade your instance via helm upgrade\n\nNow that the databases have been migrated to the latest versions, services can be scaled up and upgrade via the standard procedure. For example:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade -n <your namespace> --install -f override.yaml --version <sourcegraph version> sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\nRollback\n\nYou can revert to a previous version with the following command:\n\nSH\n$ helm rollback sourcegraph\n\nIf you are rolling back more than a single version, then you must also roll back your database, as database migrations (which may have run at some point during the upgrade) are guaranteed to be compatible with one previous minor version.\n\nDatabase Migrations\n\nBy default, database migrations will be performed during application startup by a migrator init container running prior to the frontend deployment. These migrations must succeed before Sourcegraph will become available. If the databases are large, these migrations may take a long time.\n\nIn some situations, administrators may wish to migrate their databases before upgrading the rest of the system to reduce downtime. Sourcegraph guarantees database backward compatibility to the most recent minor point release so the database can safely be upgraded before the application code.\n\nTo execute the database migrations independently, you can use the Sourcegraph Migrator helm chart.\n\nUsing Helm in restricted environment\n\nSome customers may not be allowed to directly install applications from a remote Helm Registry. In these cases, you may choose to download the chart to inspect the content, then install it locally.\n\nIt's recommended to commit your charts in a VCS repo and namespace by versions:\n\nSHELL\ncharts/\n  sourcegraph-6.1.0/\n  sourcegraph-6.2.0/\n\nDownload and untar to a specific directory at charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION:\n\nSH\n$ helm pull sourcegraph/sourcegraph --version $VERSION --untar -d charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION\n\nThen, you can install the chart from the local directory:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install sourcegraph charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION\nReviewing Changes\n\nWhen configuring an override file or performing an upgrade, we recommend reviewing the changes before applying them.\n\nUsing helm template\n\nThe helm template command can be used to render manifests for review and comparison. This is particularly useful to confirm the effect of changes to your override file. This approach does not require access to the Kubernetes server.\n\nFor example:\n\nStep 1: Render the initial manifests from your existing deployment setup to an output file:\n\nSH\n$ CHART_VERSION=0.7.0 # Currently deployed version\n$ helm template sourcegraph -f override.yaml --version $CHART_VERSION sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph > original_manifests\n\nStep 2: Make changes to your override file, and/or update the chart version, then render that output:\n\nSH\n$ CHART_VERSION=3.39.0 # Not yet deployed version\n$ helm template sourcegraph -f override.yaml --version $CHART_VERSION sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph > new_manifests\n\nStep 3: Compare the two outputs:\n\nSH\n$ diff original_manifests new_manifests\nUsing helm upgrade --dry-run\n\nSimilar to helm template, the helm upgrade --dry-run command can be used to render manifests for review and comparison. This requires access to the Kubernetes server but has the benefit of validating the Kubernetes manifests.\n\nThe following command will render and validate the manifests:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --dry-run -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\nAny validation errors will be displayed instead of the rendered manifests.\n\nIf you are having difficulty tracking down the cause of an issue, add the --debug flag to enable verbose logging:\n\nSH\n$ helm upgrade --install --dry-run --debug -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\n\nThe --debug flag will enable verbose logging and additional context, including the computed values used by the chart. This is useful when confirming your overrides have been interpreted correctly.\n\nUsing Helm Diff plugin\n\nThe Helm Diff plugin can provide a diff against a deployed chart. It is similar to the helm upgrade --dry-run option but can run against the live deployment. This requires access to the Kubernetes server.\n\nTo install the plugin, run:\n\nSH\n$ helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff\n\nThen, display a diff between a live deployment and an upgrade, with 5 lines of context:\n\nSH\n$ helm diff upgrade -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph -C 5\n\nFor more examples and configuration options, reference the Helm Diff plugin documentation.\n\nUninstalling Sourcegraph\n\nSourcegraph can be uninstalled by running the following command:\n\nSH\n$ helm uninstall sourcegraph\n\nSome Persistent Volumes may be retained after the uninstall phase is complete. In your cloud provider, check for unattached disks and delete them as necessary.\n\nPrevious\nDocker Compose\nNext\nMachine Images\nOn this page\nSourcegraph on Kubernetes with Helm\nRequirements\nWhy use Helm\nHigh-level overview of how to use Helm with Sourcegraph\nQuickstart\nConfiguration\nCloud providers guides\nUpgrading Sourcegraph\nUsing Helm in restricted environment\nReviewing Changes\nUninstalling Sourcegraph\nEdit this page on GitHub\nCopy page as Markdown\nView as Markdown",

/\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003c/QuickLinks\\u003e\\n\\n## Why use Helm\\n\\nOur Helm chart has a lot of sensible defaults baked into the values.yaml so that when an override file is used to make the changes, you _never_ have to deal with merge conflicts during upgrades (see more about customizations in the [configuration](#configuration) section).\\n\\n## High-level overview of how to use Helm with Sourcegraph\\n\\n1. Prepare any required customizations\\n\\n-   Most environments will likely require some customizations to the default Helm chart values. See _[Configuration](#configuration)_ for more information.\\n-   Additionally, resource allocations for individual services may need to be adjusted. See our _[Resource Estimator](/self-hosted/deploy/resource-estimator)_ for more information.\\n\\n2. Review the customized Helm chart\\n\\n-   There are [three mechanisms](#reviewing-changes) that can be used to review any customizations made, this is an optional step, but may be useful the first time you deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\\n\\n3. Follow the relevant platform-specific guide below to deploy Sourcegraph to your environment:\\n\\n-   [Google GKE](#configure-sourcegraph-on-google-kubernetes-engine-gke)\\n-   [AWS EKS](#configure-sourcegraph-on-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks)\\n-   [Azure AKS](#configure-sourcegraph-on-azure-managed-kubernetes-service-aks)\\n-   [Other cloud providers or on-prem](#configure-sourcegraph-on-other-cloud-providers-or-on-prem)\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tThis quickstart guide is useful to those already familiar with Helm who have\\n\\ta good understanding of how to use Helm in the environment they want to\\n\\tdeploy into, and who just want to quickly deploy Sourcegraph with Helm with\\n\\tthe default configuration. If this doesn't cover what you need to know, see\\n\\tthe links above for platform-specific guides.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\nTo use the Helm chart, add the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\\n```\\n\\nInstall the Sourcegraph chart using default values:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm install --version {CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V} sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nSourcegraph should now be available via the address set. Browsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\\n\\nMore information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here:\\n[Configuring Sourcegraph](/admin/)\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nThe Sourcegraph Helm chart is highly customizable to support a wide range of environments. We highly recommend that customizations be applied using an override file, which allows customizations to persist through upgrades without needing to manage merge conflicts.\\n\\nThe default configuration values can be viewed in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/values.yaml) file along with all [supported options](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph#configuration-options).\\n\\nTo customize configuration settings with an override file, begin by creating an empty yaml file (e.g. `override.yaml`).\\n\\n(The configuration override file can be created in advance of deployment, and the configuration override settings can be populated in preparation.)\\n\\nIt's recommended that the override file be maintained in a version control system such as GitHub, but for testing, this can be created on the machine from which the Helm deployment commands will be run.\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"warning\\\"\\u003e\\n\\t__DO NOT__ copy the [default values\\n\\tfile](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/values.yaml)\\n\\tas a boilerplate for your override file. You risk having outdated values\\n\\tduring future upgrades. Instead, only include the configuration that you\\n\\tneed to change and override.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\nExample overrides can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples) folder. Please take a look at our examples – feel free to copy and adapt them for your own override file.\\n\\nProviding the override file to Helm is done with the inclusion of the values flag and the name of the file:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version {CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V} sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nWhen making configuration changes, it's recommended to review the changes that will be applied—see [Reviewing Changes](#reviewing-changes).\\n\\n### Specific Configuration Scenarios\\n\\n#### Using external PostgreSQL databases\\n\\nTo use external PostgreSQL databases, first review our [general recommendations](/self-hosted/external-services/postgres#using-your-own-postgresql-server) and [required postgres permissions](/self-hosted/external-services/postgres#postgres-permissions-and-database-migrations).\\n\\nWe recommend storing the credentials in [Secrets] created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner. Each database requires its own Secret and should follow the following format. The Secret name can be customized as desired:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: pgsql-credentials\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    database: ''\\n    host: '' # example: pgsql.database.example.com\\n    password: ''\\n    port: ''\\n    user: ''\\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: codeintel-db-credentials\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    database: ''\\n    host: ''\\n    password: ''\\n    port: ''\\n    user: ''\\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: codeinsights-db-credentials\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    database: ''\\n    host: ''\\n    password: ''\\n    port: ''\\n    user: ''\\n    sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\\n```\\n\\nThe above Secrets should be deployed to the same namespace as the existing Sourcegraph deployment.\\n\\nYou can reference the Secrets in your [override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-databases/override.yaml) by configuring the `existingSecret` key:\\n\\n```yaml\\ncodeIntelDB:\\n    enabled: false # disables deployment of the database\\n    auth:\\n        existingSecret: codeintel-db-credentials\\n\\ncodeInsightsDB:\\n    enabled: false\\n    auth:\\n        existingSecret: codeinsights-db-credentials\\n\\npgsql:\\n    enabled: false\\n    auth:\\n        existingSecret: pgsql-credentials\\n```\\n\\nThe [using external databases](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-databases) example demonstrates this approach.\\n\\nAlthough not recommended, credentials can also be configured directly in the helm chart. For example, add the following to your override.yaml to customize pgsql credentials:\\n\\n```yaml\\npgsql:\\n    enabled: false # Disable internal pgsql database\\n    auth:\\n        database: 'custom-db'\\n        host: pgsql.database.company.com # External pgsql host\\n        user: 'new-user'\\n        password: 'new-password'\\n        port: '5432'\\n        sslmode: 'require' # optional, enable if using SSL\\n```\\n\\n#### Using external Redis instances\\n\\nTo use external Redis instances, first review our [general recommendations](/self-hosted/external-services/redis).\\n\\nIf your external Redis instances do not require authentication, you can configure access in your [override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-redis/override.yaml) with the `endpoint` settings:\\n\\n```yaml\\nredisCache:\\n    enabled: false\\n    connection:\\n        endpoint: redis://redis-cache.example.com:6379 # use a dedicated Redis, recommended\\n\\nredisStore:\\n    enabled: false\\n    connection:\\n        endpoint: redis://redis-shared.example.com:6379/2 # shared Redis, not recommended\\n```\\n\\nIf your endpoints do require authentication, we recommend storing the credentials in [Secrets] created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: redis-cache-connection\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    endpoint: ''\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: redis-store-connection\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    endpoint: ''\\n```\\n\\nYou can reference this secret in your [override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-redis/override-secret.yaml) by configuring the `existingSecret` key:\\n\\n```yaml\\nredisCache:\\n    enabled: false\\n    connection:\\n        existingSecret: redis-cache-connection\\n\\nredisStore:\\n    enabled: false\\n    connection:\\n        existingSecret: redis-store-connection\\n```\\n\\nThe [using your own Redis](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-redis) example demonstrates this approach.\\n\\n#### Using external Object Storage\\n\\nTo use an external Object Storage service (S3-compatible services, or GCS), first review our [general recommendations](/self-hosted/external-services/object-storage). Then review the following example and adjust to your use case.\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tSee\\n\\t[override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-object-storage/override.yaml)\\n\\tfor an example override file. The example assumes the use of AWS S3. You may\\n\\tconfigure the environment variables accordingly for your own use case based\\n\\ton our [general\\n\\trecommendations](/self-hosted/external-services/object-storage).\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\nIf you provide credentials with an access key / secret key, we recommend storing the credentials in [Secrets] created outside the helm chart and managed in a secure manner. An example Secret is shown here:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ''\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ''\\n```\\n\\nIn your [override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/external-object-storage/override.yaml), reference this Secret and the necessary environment variables:\\n\\n```yaml\\nblobstore:\\n    enabled: false # Disable deployment of the built-in object storage\\n\\n# we use YAML anchors and alias to keep override file clean\\nobjectStorageEnv: \\u0026objectStorageEnv\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BACKEND:\\n        value: S3 # external object storage type, one of \\\"S3\\\" or \\\"GCS\\\"\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_BUCKET:\\n        value: lsif-uploads # external object storage bucket name\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ENDPOINT:\\n        value: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_REGION:\\n        value: us-east-1\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:\\n        secretKeyRef: # Pre-existing secret, not created by this chart\\n            name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\\n            key: PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\\n    PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:\\n        secretKeyRef: # Pre-existing secret, not created by this chart\\n            name: sourcegraph-s3-credentials\\n            key: PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\\n\\nfrontend:\\n    env:\\n        \\u003c\\u003c: *objectStorageEnv\\n\\npreciseCodeIntel:\\n    env:\\n        \\u003c\\u003c: *objectStorageEnv\\n```\\n\\n#### Using SSH to clone repositories\\n\\nCreate a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) that contains the base64 encoded contents of your SSH private key (make sure it doesn't require a passphrase) and known_hosts file. The [Secret] will be mounted in the `gitserver` deployment to authenticate with your code host.\\n\\nIf you have access to the ssh keys locally, you can run the command below to create the secret:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl create secret generic gitserver-ssh \\\\\\n    --from-file id_rsa=${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa \\\\\\n    --from-file known_hosts=${HOME}/.ssh/known_hosts\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you may manually create the secret from a manifest file.\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"warning\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tDo NOT commit the secret manifest into your Git repository unless you are\\n\\tokay with storing sensitive information in plaintext and your repository is\\n\\tprivate.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\nCreate a file with the following and save it as `gitserver-ssh.Secret.yaml`\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: gitserver-ssh\\ndata:\\n    # notes: secrets data has to be base64-encoded\\n    id_rsa: ''\\n    known_hosts: ''\\n```\\n\\nApply the created [Secret] with the command below:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl apply -f gitserver-ssh.Secret.yaml\\n```\\n\\nYou should add the following values to your override file to reference the [Secret] you created earlier.\\n\\n```yaml\\ngitserver:\\n    sshSecret: gitserver-ssh\\n```\\n\\n### Advanced Configuration Methods\\n\\nThe Helm chart is new and still under active development, and our values.yaml (and therefore the customization available to use via an override file) may not cover every need. Equally, some changes are environment or customer-specific, and so will never be part of the default Sourcegraph Helm chart.\\n\\nThe following guidance for using Kustomize with Helm and Helm Subcharts covers both of these scenarios.\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"warning\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tWhile both of these approaches are available, deployment changes that are\\n\\tnot covered by Sourcegraph documentation should be discussed with either\\n\\tyour Customer Engineer or Support contact before proceeding, to ensure the\\n\\tchanges proposed can be supported by Sourcegraph. This also allows\\n\\tSourcegraph to consider adding the required customizations to the Helm\\n\\tchart.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n#### Integrate Kustomize with Helm chart\\n\\nFor advanced users who are looking for a temporary workaround, we **recommend** applying [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) on the rendered manifests from our chart. Please **do not** maintain your own fork of our chart, this may impact our ability to support you if you run into issues.\\n\\nYou can learn more about how to integrate Kustomize with Helm from our [example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/kustomize-chart).\\n\\n#### Helm subcharts\\n\\n[Helm subcharts](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/) can be used for permanent customizations to the official Sourcegraph helm chart. This is useful for changes such as adding a new resource unique to your deployment (PodSecurityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, additional services, etc.). These are long-lived customizations that shouldn't be contributed back to the Sourcegraph helm chart.\\n\\nWith a subchart, you create your own helm chart and specify the Sourcegraph chart as a dependency. Any resources you place in the templates folder of your chart will be deployed, as well as the Sourcegraph resources, allowing you to extend the Sourcegraph chart without maintaining a fork.\\n\\nAn example of a subchart is shown in the [examples/subchart](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples) folder.\\n\\nMore details on how to create and configure a subchart can be found in the [helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals).\\n\\n### Tracing\\n\\nSourcegraph supports HTTP tracing to help troubleshoot issues. See [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) for details.\\n\\nTo enable tracing on your Helm instance, you'll need to either:\\n\\n1. Deploy our bundled Jaeger backend, or\\n2. Configure an external tracing backend\\n\\nOnce a tracing backend has been deployed, see our [Tracing](/self-hosted/observability/tracing) page for next steps, including required changes to your Site Configuration to enable traces.\\n\\n#### Enable the bundled Jaeger deployment\\n\\nSourcegraph bundles a Jaeger instance, but it is disabled by default. You can enable it by either adding this to your Helm values override file, or by appending the [jaeger/override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/jaeger/override.yaml) file to your Helm upgrade command.\\n\\n```yaml\\njaeger:\\n    enabled: true\\n```\\n\\n#### Configure OpenTelemetry Collector to use an external tracing backend\\n\\nTo configure the bundled otel-collector to export traces to an external OTel-compatible backend, you you can customize the otel-collector's config file directly in your Helm values `override.yaml` file.\\n\\nFor the specific configurations to set, see our [OpenTelemetry](/self-hosted/observability/opentelemetry) page.\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenTelemetry:\\n    gateway:\\n        config:\\n            traces:\\n                exporters:\\n                    # Your exporter configuration here\\n                processors:\\n                    # Your processor configuration here\\n```\\n\\nTo use an external Jaeger instance, copy and customize the configs from the [opentelemetry-exporter/override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/opentelemetry-exporter/override.yaml) file, and add them to your Helm values override file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenTelemetry:\\n    gateway:\\n        env:\\n            JAEGER_HOST:\\n                value: 'http://your.jaeger.endpoint'\\n        config:\\n            traces:\\n                exporters:\\n                    jaeger:\\n                        endpoint: '$JAEGER_HOST:14250'\\n                        tls:\\n                            insecure: true\\n```\\n\\n#### Configure a tracing backend with TLS enabled\\n\\nIf you require a TLS connection to export trace data, you need to first add the certificate data to a secret. The following snippet demonstrates how you can achieve this:\\n\\n\\u003e Do NOT commit the secret manifest into your Git repository unless you are okay with storing sensitive information in plaintext and your repository is private.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: otel-collector-exporters-tls\\ndata:\\n    file.cert: '\\u003c.cert data\\u003e'\\n    file.key: '\\u003c.key data\\u003e'\\n```\\n\\nAfter applying the secret to your cluster, you can use the [opentelemetry-exporter/override-tls.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/opentelemetry-exporter/override-tls.yaml) example, and configure the value `openTelemetry.gateway.config.traces.exportersTlsSecretName` in your Helm values override file to mount the certificate data in the otel-collector, and instruct the exporter to use TLS:\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenTelemetry:\\n    gateway:\\n        env:\\n            JAEGER_HOST:\\n                value: 'http://your.jaeger.endpoint'\\n        config:\\n            traces:\\n                exportersTlsSecretName: otel-collector-exporters-tls\\n                exporters:\\n                    jaeger:\\n                        endpoint: '$JAEGER_HOST:14250'\\n                        tls:\\n                            cert_file: /tls/file.cert\\n                            key_file: /tls/file.key\\n```\\n\\n#### Configure trace sampling\\n\\nReview the [trace sampling](/self-hosted/observability/opentelemetry#sampling-traces) documentation, and the [opentelemetry-exporter/override-processor.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/opentelemetry-exporter/override-processor.yaml) example, then add the configs to your Helm values override file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nopenTelemetry:\\n    gateway:\\n        config:\\n            traces:\\n                processors:\\n                    probabilistic_sampler:\\n                        hash_seed: 22 # An integer used to compute the hash algorithm. Note that all collectors for a given tier (e.g. behind the same load balancer) should have the same hash_seed.\\n                        sampling_percentage: 10.0 # (default = 0): Percentage at which traces are sampled; \\u003e= 100 samples all traces\\n```\\n\\n## Cloud providers guides\\n\\nThis section is aimed at providing high-level guidance on deploying Sourcegraph via Helm on major Cloud providers. In general, you need the following to get started:\\n\\n-   A working Kubernetes cluster, v1.19 or higher\\n-   The ability to provision persistent volumes, e.g. have Block Storage [CSI storage driver](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html) installed\\n-   An Ingress Controller installed, e.g. platform native ingress controller, [NGINX Ingress Controller].\\n-   The ability to create DNS records for Sourcegraph, e.g. `sourcegraph.company.com`\\n\\n### Configure Sourcegraph on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\n1. You need to have a GKE cluster (\\u003e=1.19) with the `HTTP Load Balancing` addon enabled. Alternatively, you can use your own choice of Ingress Controller and disable the `HTTP Load Balancing` add-on, [learn more](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/custom-ingress-controller).\\n2. Your account should have sufficient access rights, equivalent to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.\\n3. Connect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using `gcloud`) and ensure the cluster is up and running by running: `kubectl get nodes` (several `ready` nodes should be listed)\\n4. Have the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed and run the following command to link to the Sourcegraph helm repository (on the machine used to interact with your cluster):\\n\\n\\u003e Please note that Autopilot clusters are not supported. Google managed clusters have security constraints that prevent the setup of the Sourcegraph services.\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm repo add sourcegraph https://helm.sourcegraph.com/release\\n```\\n\\n#### Steps\\n\\n**Step 1:** – Create your override file and add in any configuration override settings you need—see [configuration](#configuration) for more information on override files and the options for what can be configured.\\n\\nAdd into your override file the below values to configure both your ingress hostname and your storage class. We recommend configuring Ingress to use [Container-native load balancing] to expose Sourcegraph publicly on a domain of your choosing and setting the Storage Class to use [Compute Engine persistent disk]. (For an example file see [override.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/tree/main/charts/sourcegraph/examples/gcp/override.yaml))\\n\\n```yaml\\nfrontend:\\n    serviceType: ClusterIP\\n    ingress:\\n        enabled: true\\n        annotations:\\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce\\n    # To enable HTTPS using a self-managed certificate\\n    #    tlsSecret: example-secret\\n    #    host: sourcegraph.example.com\\n    serviceAnnotations:\\n        cloud.google.com/neg: '{\\\"ingress\\\": true}'\\n        # Reference the `BackendConfig` CR created below\\n        beta.cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{\\\"default\\\": \\\"sourcegraph-frontend\\\"}'\\n\\nstorageClass:\\n    create: true\\n    type: pd-ssd # This configures SSDs (recommended).\\n    provisioner: pd.csi.storage.gke.io\\n    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer\\n    reclaimPolicy: Retain\\n\\nextraResources:\\n    - apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1\\n      kind: BackendConfig\\n      metadata:\\n          name: sourcegraph-frontend\\n      spec:\\n          healthCheck:\\n              checkIntervalSec: 5\\n              timeoutSec: 5\\n              requestPath: /ready\\n              port: 6060 # we use a custom port to perform healthcheck\\n```\\n\\nThe override file includes a [BackendConfig] CRD. This is necessary to instruct the GCP load balancer on how to perform health checks on our deployment.\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\t[Container-native load balancing] is only available on VPC-native clusters.\\n\\tFor legacy clusters, [learn\\n\\tmore](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress).\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tOptionally, you can review the changes using one of [three\\n\\tmechanisms](#reviewing-changes) that can be used to assess the\\n\\tcustomizations made. This is not required, but may be useful the first time\\n\\tyou deploy Sourcegraph, for peace of mind.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n**Step 2:** – Install the chart\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install --values ./override.yaml --version {CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V} sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nIt will take around 10 minutes for the load balancer to be fully ready, you may check on the status and obtain the load balancer IP using the following command:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl describe ingress sourcegraph-frontend\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3:** – Upon obtaining the allocated IP address of the load balancer, you should create a DNS A record for the `sourcegraph.company.com` domain. Finally, it is recommended to enable TLS and you may consider using [Google-managed certificate](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs) in GKE or your own certificate.\\n\\nIf using a GKE manage certificate, add the following annotations to Ingress:\\n\\n```yaml\\nfrontend:\\n    ingress:\\n        annotations:\\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: null\\n            networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: managed-cert # replace with actual Google-managed certificate name\\n            # if you reserve a static IP, uncomment below and update ADDRESS_NAME\\n            # also, make changes to your DNS record accordingly\\n            # kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: ADDRESS_NAME\\n```\\n\\nIf using your own certificate, you can do so with [TLS Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets).\\n\\n**Step 4:** Create a file with the following and save it as `sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml`\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n    name: sourcegraph-frontend-tls\\ntype: kubernetes.io/tls\\ndata:\\n    # the data is abbreviated in this example\\n    tls.crt: |\\n        MIIC2DCCAcCgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqh ...\\n    tls.key: |\\n        MIIEpgIBAAKCAQEA7yn3bRHQ5FHMQ ...\\n```\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl apply -f ./sourcegraph-frontend-tls.Secret.yaml\\n```\\n\\nAdd the following values to your override file.\\n\\n```yaml\\nfrontend:\\n    ingress:\\n        enabled: true\\n        annotations:\\n            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce\\n        tlsSecret: sourcegraph-frontend-tls # reference the created TLS Secret\\n        # replace with your actual domain\\n        host: sourcegraph.company.com\\n```\\n\\n**Step 5** – Validate the deployment\\nSourcegraph should now be available via the address set.\\nBrowsing to the url should now provide access to the Sourcegraph UI to create the initial administrator account.\\n\\n**Step 6** – Further configuration\\n\\nNow the deployment is complete. More information on configuring the Sourcegraph application can be found here:\\n[Configuring Sourcegraph](/admin/)\\n\\n### Configure Sourcegraph on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\n1. You need to have a EKS cluster (\\u003e=1.19) with the following addons enabled:\\n\\n-   [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)\\n-   [AWS EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html)\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tYou may consider deploying your own Ingress Controller instead of the ALB\\n\\tIngress Controller, [learn\\n\\tmore](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n2. Your account should have sufficient access equivalent to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.\\n3. Connect to your cluster (via either the console or the command line using `eksctl`) and ensure the cluster is up and running using: `kubectl get nodes` (several `ready` nodes should be listed)\\n4.

Admins\\n    seeking to upgrade to any Sourcegraph version `v6.0.x` or later (including\\n    `v6.1.x`, `v6.2.x`, etc.) must first upgrade to `v5.10.3940` or\\n    `v5.11.6271` and then use the standard upgrade procedure to get to their\\n    target version. This is because migrator in all versions from `v6.0.0`\\n    onwards will no longer connect to Postgres 12 databases. For more info see\\n    our [PostgreSQL upgrade docs](/self-hosted/postgres#requirements).\\n\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\nScale down `deployments` and `statefulSets` that access the database, _this step prevents services from accessing the database while schema migrations are in process._\\nThe following services must have their replicas scaled to 0:\\n\\n-   Deployments (e.g., `kubectl scale deployment \\u003cname\\u003e --replicas=0`)\\n-   precise-code-intel-worker\\n-   searcher\\n-   sourcegraph-frontend\\n-   sourcegraph-frontend-internal\\n-   worker\\n-   Stateful sets (e.g., `kubectl scale sts \\u003cname\\u003e --replicas=0`):\\n-   gitserver\\n-   indexed-search\\n\\nThe following convenience commands provide an example of scaling down the necessary services in a single command:\\n\\nDeployments:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl get -n sourcegraph deploy --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 -P 8 -I % kubectl -n sourcegraph scale deployment % --replicas=0\\n```\\n\\nStatefulSets:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl -n sourcegraph get sts --selector 'app.kubernetes.io/component!=codeinsights-db,app.kubernetes.io/component!=codeintel-db,app.kubernetes.io/component!=pgsql' --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 -P 8 -I % kubectl -n sourcegraph scale sts % --replicas=0\\n```\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tThe commands above use the `sourcegraph` namespace and are specific to the\\n\\tkubernetes-helm deployment.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n**Step 3:** **Run the migrator `upgrade` command**\\n\\nThe following command is the general template for running an upgrade\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install -n \\u003cyour namespace\\u003e --set \\\"migrator.args={upgrade,--from=\\u003ccurrent version\\u003e,--to=\\u003cversion to upgrade to\\u003e}\\\" sourcegraph-migrator sourcegraph/sourcegraph-migrator --version \\u003cmigrator image version\\u003e\\n```\\n\\n\\u003cCallout type=\\\"note\\\"\\u003e\\n\\tThe command above is general and you'll need to substitute in your own\\n\\tnamespace, target sourcegraph version, and desired migrator image version.\\n\\tIn general run the most recent version of migrator.\\n\\u003c/Callout\\u003e\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install -n sourcegraph --set \\\"migrator.args={upgrade,--from=3.41.0,--to=4.5.1}\\\" sourcegraph-migrator sourcegraph/sourcegraph-migrator --version {CURRENT_VERSION_NO_V}\\nRelease \\\"sourcegraph-migrator\\\" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!\\nNAME: sourcegraph-migrator\\nLAST DEPLOYED: Tue Mar  7 18:23:56 2023\\nNAMESPACE: sourcegraph\\nSTATUS: deployed\\nREVISION: 2\\nTEST SUITE: None\\n✅ Out of band migrations complete\\n👉 Migrating to v4.5 (step 3 of 3)\\n👉 Running schema migrations\\n✅ Schema migrations complete\\n```\\n\\nYou can learn more about running migrator operations in helm in the [migrator operations doc](/self-hosted/updates/migrator/migrator-operations#kubernetes-helm).\\n\\n**Step 4:** **Upgrade your instance via `helm upgrade`**\\n\\nNow that the databases have been migrated to the latest versions, services can be scaled up and upgrade via the [standard procedure](#standard-upgrades). For example:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade -n \\u003cyour namespace\\u003e --install -f override.yaml --version \\u003csourcegraph version\\u003e sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\n### Rollback\\n\\nYou can revert to a previous version with the following command:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm rollback sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nIf you are rolling back more than a single version, then you must also [roll back your database](/self-hosted/how-to/rollback-database), as database migrations (which may have run at some point during the upgrade) are guaranteed to be compatible with one previous minor version.\\n\\n### Database Migrations\\n\\nBy default, database migrations will be performed during application startup by a `migrator` init container running prior to the `frontend` deployment. These migrations **must** succeed before Sourcegraph will become available. If the databases are large, these migrations may take a long time.\\n\\nIn some situations, administrators may wish to migrate their databases before upgrading the rest of the system to reduce downtime. Sourcegraph guarantees database backward compatibility to the most recent minor point release so the database can safely be upgraded before the application code.\\n\\nTo execute the database migrations independently, you can use the [Sourcegraph Migrator] helm chart.\\n\\n## Using Helm in restricted environment\\n\\nSome customers may not be allowed to directly install applications from a remote Helm Registry. In these cases, you may choose to download the chart to inspect the content, then install it locally.\\n\\nIt's recommended to commit your charts in a VCS repo and namespace by versions:\\n\\n```\\ncharts/\\n  sourcegraph-6.1.0/\\n  sourcegraph-6.2.0/\\n```\\n\\nDownload and untar to a specific directory at `charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION`:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm pull sourcegraph/sourcegraph --version $VERSION --untar -d charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can install the chart from the local directory:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install sourcegraph charts/sourcegraph-$VERSION\\n```\\n\\n## Reviewing Changes\\n\\nWhen configuring an override file or performing an upgrade, we recommend reviewing the changes before applying them.\\n\\n### Using helm template\\n\\nThe helm template command can be used to render manifests for review and comparison. This is particularly useful to confirm the effect of changes to your override file. This approach does not require access to the Kubernetes server.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n**Step 1:** Render the initial manifests from your existing deployment setup to an output file:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ CHART_VERSION=0.7.0 # Currently deployed version\\n$ helm template sourcegraph -f override.yaml --version $CHART_VERSION sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph \\u003e original_manifests\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2:** Make changes to your override file, and/or update the chart version, then render that output:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ CHART_VERSION=3.39.0 # Not yet deployed version\\n$ helm template sourcegraph -f override.yaml --version $CHART_VERSION sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph \\u003e new_manifests\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3:** Compare the two outputs:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ diff original_manifests new_manifests\\n```\\n\\n### Using helm upgrade --dry-run\\n\\nSimilar to `helm template`, the `helm upgrade --dry-run` command can be used to render manifests for review and comparison. This requires access to the Kubernetes server but has the benefit of validating the Kubernetes manifests.\\n\\nThe following command will render and validate the manifests:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install --dry-run -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nAny validation errors will be displayed instead of the rendered manifests.\\n\\nIf you are having difficulty tracking down the cause of an issue, add the `--debug` flag to enable verbose logging:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm upgrade --install --dry-run --debug -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nThe `--debug` flag will enable verbose logging and additional context, including the computed values used by the chart. This is useful when confirming your overrides have been interpreted correctly.\\n\\n### Using Helm Diff plugin\\n\\nThe [Helm Diff] plugin can provide a diff against a deployed chart. It is similar to the `helm upgrade --dry-run` option but can run against the live deployment. This requires access to the Kubernetes server.\\n\\nTo install the plugin, run:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff\\n```\\n\\nThen, display a diff between a live deployment and an upgrade, with 5 lines of context:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm diff upgrade -f override.yaml sourcegraph sourcegraph/sourcegraph -C 5\\n```\\n\\nFor more examples and configuration options, reference the [Helm Diff] plugin documentation.\\n\\n## Uninstalling Sourcegraph\\n\\nSourcegraph can be uninstalled by running the following command:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ helm uninstall sourcegraph\\n```\\n\\nSome Persistent Volumes may be retained after the uninstall phase is complete. In your cloud provider, check for unattached disks and delete them as necessary.\\n\\n[backendconfig]:
