## Phase Definition

### What This Phase Covers
AI-powered tools that assist with requirements gathering, user story generation, business requirements documentation (BRD), and stakeholder communication during the initial phases of software projects.

### Tool Categories
- [ ] Requirements Management Platforms (AI-enhanced)
- [ ] User Story Generators
- [ ] BRD/PRD Automation Tools
- [ ] Stakeholder Interview Assistants
- [ ] Requirements Traceability Tools
- [ ] Natural Language to Requirements Converters

### Out of Scope
- General project management tools without AI requirements features
- Pure documentation tools (Confluence, Notion) without requirements-specific AI
- Design tools (covered in Design-Build phase)
- Test case generation from requirements (covered in Quality-Engineering)

---

## Discovery Parameters

### Search Strategies
```
Primary searches:
- "AI requirements gathering tool" site:*.io OR site:*.ai
- "automated user story generation" enterprise
- "requirements management AI" Gartner OR Forrester
- "BRD automation" generative AI
- "product requirements document AI"

Secondary searches:
- "natural language requirements" software
- "stakeholder interview AI assistant"
- "requirements traceability AI"
- GitHub: topics/requirements-management + AI
- ProductHunt: requirements + AI launches 2024-2025
```

### Inclusion Criteria
Tools MUST meet ALL of:
- [ ] Specifically designed for software/product requirements
- [ ] Uses AI/ML for generation, analysis, or enhancement
- [ ] Produces structured output (user stories, BRDs, acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Meets at least one federal requirement from VISION.md

### Exclusion Criteria
- [ ] Generic chatbots without requirements specialization
- [ ] Tools focused solely on project management/tracking
- [ ] Tools that only organize existing requirements (no AI generation)
- [ ] Consumer-focused tools not suitable for enterprise

## Analysis Focus

Beyond the standard VISION.md dimensions, this phase specifically examines:

### Phase-Specific Questions
1. How does the tool handle ambiguous or incomplete stakeholder input?
2. Can it generate acceptance criteria alongside user stories?
3. Does it support requirements versioning and change tracking?
4. Can it identify conflicts or gaps in requirements sets?
5. How does it handle domain-specific terminology and jargon?

### Integration Points
- **Upstream:** Stakeholder interviews, market research, existing documentation
- **Downstream:** Design-Build (architecture decisions), Quality-Engineering (test generation)

---

## Extraction Priorities

For entities in this phase, prioritize these schema types:

| Schema Type | Priority | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| `compliance` | Critical | Federal viability gate |
| `features` | High | Core capability mapping |
| `integrations` | High | ALM/PLM ecosystem fit |
| `pricing` | Medium | Budget planning |
| `company` | Low | Background only |
